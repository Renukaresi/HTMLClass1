        Images are placed on the page through the use of the <b>img</b> tag. Images are 
      considered <b>replaced content</b>, that is the element is replaced with the asset it references. 
      The image element has several important attributes. The <b>src</b> attribute is used to tell the 
      browser where to find the image. The <b>alt</b> attribute allows you to pass along descriptive text 
      representing the image. This can be used by screen readers, or displayed in the event the image fails 
      to load.The <b>width</b> and <b>height</b> are optional and can be used to pass the dimensions of the 
      image to the browser. If omitted, the browser will still display the image at its native width and height. 
      These values can be changed to force the browser to size the image differently from it's native size.</p>  
      <p>   
        Images can be of any extension. Most of them are supported
        <img src="images/flower.png" width="200" height="200" alt="Colourful Flower">
