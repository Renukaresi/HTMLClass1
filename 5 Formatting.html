    <h2> b & strong</h2>
    <p>
    In HTML5 &lang;strong&rang; and &lang;b&rang; both exist and have a different meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
    &lang;b&rang; tag is for "offset text conventionally styled in bold". If you read deeper into the details you'll see it adds, 
    "without conveying any extra emphasis or importance".
    </p>
    <p>
    &lang;strong&rang; is different. It "represents a span of text with strong importance." There is semantic meaning of importance here. 
    In fact, a &lang;strong&rang; tag within another &lang;strong&rang; tag has even more importance. There is nested importance. 
    The html5 spec is enlightening on this.

    <h2> i & em</h2>
    <p>
    Like the bold tag, the italic tag (&lang;i&rang;) represents a string of text that is "set apart stylistically 
    from the text around it". No particular meaning is attached to the text, rather it is rendered in italics. 
    Helpful for phrases, terms, or any text that is normally displayed in italics.
    </p>
    <p>
    The emphasis tag (&lang;em&rang;), or "em" tag, denotes text that is "emphasized more than the text around it". 
    Although this tag is usually rendered in italics, it shouldn't be used in place of the italics tag, rather it 
    should be used for text that needs to emphasized for some reason.
